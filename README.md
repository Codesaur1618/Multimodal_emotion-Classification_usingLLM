# 🎭 Multimodal Emotion Analysis with LLaMA Inference

This Flask-based web application performs **emotion analysis** from **text**, **audio**, and **video** inputs. It leverages multiple models to detect emotional states, identify underlying causes, and generate natural, human-like inferences using the **LLaMA language model** via Ollama.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Text Emotion Detection**  
  Classifies emotions from user-inputted text and extracts the likely cause.

- **Audio Emotion Analysis**  
  Converts audio to a standard format, detects vocal emotion, transcribes speech, and analyzes text emotion.

- **Video Emotion Detection**  
  Extracts visual emotions from facial cues, analyzes speech audio, and integrates transcription-based emotion classification.

- **LLM-Based Inference**  
  Summarizes emotional findings in a natural, friendly tone using LLaMA via Ollama.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask  
- **Audio/Video**: `moviepy`, `pydub`, custom `audio_utils.py` & `video_utils.py`  
- **Emotion Models**: Pre-trained models for audio, text, and visual emotion detection  
- **LLM Integration**: Local Ollama installation running `llama3.2`  

---

## 🧪 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Local installation of **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** with `llama3.2` model
- Folders: Ensure `uploads/` directory exists

---

## 📦 Running the App

```bash
python app.py
```

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.
